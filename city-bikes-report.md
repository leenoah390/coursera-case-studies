###Introduction and Goals###
Cyclistic is a bike-share company operating in Chicago since 2016. The company provides customers access to its fleet of bikes by way of short-term passes (single-ride, full-day) and annual memberships. Customers who purchase short-term passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

The company’s current marketing strategy is based on a general awareness approach in targeting all potential customers. The director of marketing, Lily Moreno, believes in targeting Cyclistic’s casual rider market and turning more casual riders into members.

Before making such decisions, we must analyze the habits of casual riders and how they differ from members to determine what is holding back these casual riders from purchasing memberships over short-term passes.
